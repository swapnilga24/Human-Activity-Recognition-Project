# HumanActivity  : Project
 
A data science project in which we are going to predict the activity of a user currently executing using a
Smartphone. For this, we use an androsensor app to get the data of accelerometer and gyroscope with 3 axes
(x, y, and z) from the smartphone. Data set was created at runtime and no. of activities was limited to 4
which include walking, laying, standing, and sitting. The data was analyzed using various machine learning
algorithms and compared for max accuracy. The language used for that is R and using Shine we host the R
code. It was then integrated with a UI through PHP.

Software Tools/Skills:

 Python, R, ML, PHP, HTML, CSS.

Role & Responsibilities:

 Requirements analysis of new features
 Requirements analysis of data set
 Worked on Different Machine learning Algorithms.
 Worked on Shine App Code.
